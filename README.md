# Binary-Metal-Classifier
In this project, I have created a binary sound classifier that can classify whether the sound is created due to metal - metal hit or metal - non metal hit.

Inspectbot-data contains the data that we manually collected by hitting a metal with different objects.\\
Inspectbot-test contains the augmented testing data which was also collected by hitting different objects with a metal.
Inspectbot-augmented is the training data which we obtain after data augmentation. It contains over 300 sound files containing both metal-metal hit and metal-other hit.
MM in the beginning of each data file means that it is a metal-metal hit. While OO means Metal-other hit.
